## Description

This site gives you the option to search through a large list of cocktails sourced from [The Cocktail DB's Database](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).

A user is able to search for a drink by name, find a drink by random, and also circulate through a list of similar names. If user has neither chose a drink by random or searched for one, the `Back` and `Next` buttons will circulate through the drinks that begin with 'A'

## Future Additions

- Rotate buttons are able to circulate through drinks from A then A - Z, if no drinks are searched for
- Users are able to make an account and save drinks
- Users are able to share drinks through messages/social media
- Users can cross off ingredients as they are gathered
